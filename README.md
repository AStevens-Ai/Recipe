This is a test project , i havent really added too much to it at the moment, will build on it later, but its a basic building block for me to practice, and give to my newer developer friends/family to practice basic things. 

Overview-
this is a project that uses basic html, css, and a little bit of javascript to make a recipe website that has clickable links that route to extended html pages of recipes with titles of the recipe item. The javascript is unrelated and is just a fun little addition to ask what you do , if you say you are a developer it gives you a silly question, if you say game designer it makes fun of you unless you use gameMaker , all fun and jokes.
